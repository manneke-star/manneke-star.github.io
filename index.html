    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Cyberbullying is bullying that occurs through digital devices like cell phones, computers, and tablets. It
      includes sending, posting, or sharing negative, harmful, or false content about someone else, often with the
      intent to embarrass or humiliate. Addressing cyberbullying is crucial as it can have severe emotional,
      psychological, and even physical consequences for victims. Raising awareness can help prevent it and provide
      support to those affected. Cyberbullying on Instagram involves the use of social media to harass, threaten, or
      intimidate someone.</p>
    <h3>Key Statistics</h3>
    <p>Instagram is the social media site where most young people report experiencing cyberbullying, with 42% of those
      surveyed experiencing harassment on the platform. Young people who experience cyberbullying are at a greater risk
      than those who don't for both self-harm and suicidal behaviors.</p>
    <h3>Why It Matters</h3>
    <p>Cyberbullying can contribute to many mental health problems, putting young people at higher risk of anxiety and
      depression. Those who experience cyberbullying are also at higher risk of engaging in self-harm and experiencing
      suicidal thoughts.</p>

      <h3>Analysis</h3>
      <p>No app is more integral to teens‚Äô social lives than Instagram. While Millennials relied on Facebook to navigate
        high school and college, connect with friends, and express themselves online, Gen Z‚Äôs networks exist almost
        entirely on Instagram. According to a recent study by the Pew Research Center, 72 percent of teens use the
        platform, which now has more than 1 billion monthly users. Instagram allows teens to chat with people they know,
        meet new people, stay in touch with friends from camp or sports, and bond by sharing photos or having
        discussions. Cyberbullying perpetrators have high-stress levels, poor school performance, and an increased risk
        of depression and alcohol misuse. Furthermore, research shows that adolescents who were victims or perpetrators
        of cyberbullying in their adolescence continue to engage in similar behavior into early adulthood </p>

      <p>- It's now been one year since 16-year-old McKenna Brown took her own life. She was a goalie on the ice, but in
        the hours before her death, her parents say she became the victim of a severe cyber-bullying campaign by
        teammates to cancel her and leave her without any friends. The text messages read in part, "You've done all of
        us so wrong" and "I hope I never see you again." The messages were sent to McKenna by a teammate who Cheryl says
        was upset about a boy McKenna was talking to. They also learned in speaking with McKenna's friends that she was
        sexually assaulted by a teammate's older brother when she was 13 years old.</p>
